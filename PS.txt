Build a Federated Machine Learning framework for QML. 

You are welcome to adapt any existing Federated Tools to the purposes of Quantum Computing.

You should be able to successfully train QML models – at least simple ones - 
using the federated learning framework of your choice or design.

Develop QML models and algorithms to handle high-dimensional data, such as images or genomics datasets.

It is highly encouraged to present your results using Jupyter notebooks with actual experiments 
and an explanation of each step.

Bonus prizes will be awarded for excellence in achieving the extra milestones below:

● Architecture is deployable on the cloud: $100

● The model can handle high dimensional data sets such as MRI images: $200

● The Federated Framework includes other PETs such as Homomorphic Encryption: $300

● The Federated Framework is multimodal i.e. it can handle more than one data
modality during the training: $400
